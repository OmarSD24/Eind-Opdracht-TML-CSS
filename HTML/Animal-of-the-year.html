                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>Jaguars (*Panthera onca*) are powerful big cats native to Central and South America, particularly thriving in rainforests, swamps, and areas near water. Known for their exceptional strength, they have the strongest bite of any big cat, allowing them to crush hard prey like turtle shells and even hunt caimans. Jaguars are skilled swimmers, with a diet that includes deer, fish, and capybaras. Despite their adaptability, they are currently Near Threatened due to habitat loss and poaching, although they hold cultural significance as symbols of strength in Indigenous cultures.</p>
