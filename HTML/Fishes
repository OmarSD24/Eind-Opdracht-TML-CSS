                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>The Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is a large, powerful predator that can grow up to 20 feet long and weigh over 4,000 pounds. Found in coastal and offshore waters worldwide, it primarily feeds on fish, seals, and sea lions. With exceptional senses, including the ability to detect blood from miles away and sense movement through electroreception, it is highly adept at hunting. Unlike most fish, it can regulate its body temperature, allowing it to thrive in various water temperatures. Known for breaching the water to catch prey, great whites can live up to 70 years. Although classified as vulnerable due to threats like fishing and habitat loss, they remain a vital part of ocean ecosystems. Despite their reputation, great whites rarely attack humans, and most encounters are due to mistaken identity.</p>
